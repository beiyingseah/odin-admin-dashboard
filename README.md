# admin-dashboard

For my 7th project for The Odin Project, I build a full dashboard design. For the purposes of this lesson, I lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. 


KEY TAKEAWAYS

TODOs
1. Layout: Laying down the most basic lay of the land: HTML & CSS elements for sidebar, header and main-content containers
2. Nesting: Fitting child elements under the respective sections within grids
3. Responsive layout
- To enable dynamic expansion and shrinking of project cards section when browser window is resized by user
- To apply minmax to Dashboard, Header & Widget sections to control extent of shrinking

EXTRA CREDIT
1. Add personal flair to dashboard's colour palette & icons 
2. Add real functionality to content: (i) Links to actual project repos in GitHub for the respective project cards (ii) Link to GitHub profile for profile name & icon (iii) Links back to index page ("/#")
