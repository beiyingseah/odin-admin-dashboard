# admin-dashboard

For my 7th project for The Odin Project, I build a full dashboard design. For the purposes of this lesson, I lean on Grid for most of the layout work. 


## KEY LEARNINGS FROM INTERMEDIATE HTML & CSS APPLIED
- Html tag; structural pseudo-classes for implementing light/dark theme (:root); child combinator to select only child divs for setting base margin & padding settings; grid-auto-flows

TODOs
1. Layout: Laying down the most basic lay of the land: HTML & CSS elements for sidebar, header and main-content containers
2. Nesting: Fitting child elements under the respective sections within grids
3. Responsive layout
- To enable dynamic expansion and shrinking of project cards section when browser window is resized by user
- To apply minmax to Sidebar, Header & Widget sections to control extent of shrinking

## EXTRA CREDIT
1. Added personal flair to dashboard's colour palette & icons 
2. Added real functionality to content: (i) Links to actual project repos in GitHub for the respective project cards (ii) Link to GitHub profile for profile name & icon (iii) Links in navigation panel back to index page ("/#")

## FUTURE VERSIONS
1. Animate the browsing (hovering) of (i) navigation bar options (ii) Buttons (iii) Cards to provide positive user feedback
2. Add Dark/Light Mode in place of the DP on top-right corner: (i) toggle design (ii) actual functionality with JS (revision time!)
